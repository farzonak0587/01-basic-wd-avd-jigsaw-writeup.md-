## Concept: Applied Visual Design Jigsaw

### Section: Context 
We were still in Web Design, Unit 1, but this time the theme was Applied Visual Design. Although this covered the fundamentals of CSS, some of the subjects were far more complex. For instance, there were the basics, typography, geometry, colors, animation, and positioning. You could use a lot more of the new elements for decorating your webpage.

#### Basics of Applied Visual Design: 
* Basics ( strong/bold `strong`, u/underline `u`, em/italicized `em`, strikethrough `s`,horizontal line `hr`,`opacity`, `box-shadow` and other CSS basics)
* Typography ( `text-transform:`, Font Size, `font-weight:#px`, `line-heigt:#px` and Hover) 
* Colors ( Hex Codes, Dominant and Complementary colors, `linear-gradient`,`repeating-linear-gradient`, HSL and Subtle Pattern for Background)
* Positioning ( `position: relative`, `position: absoulte`, `position: fixed`, `float: direction`, `z-index` and `margin:auto`)
* Geometry (`transform: scale(#)`,`transform: skewY (#deg)`, skewX, :before, and :after )
* Animation ( `animation:name;`, `animation-duration: #ms;`,`Content:hover`,`Animation-Iteration-Count: #;`,Keyframes, Opactiy,and Movement)
 

#### Process: 
Due to the large number of Free Code Camp Lessons on Applied Visual Design, our class was forced to divide up and focus on a single topic in groups. Our partner and those behind us had to work together. There were only five topics available for us to select from because my teacher had previously covered one. My group and I decided on colors as our second option and positioning as our first. After receiving our first choice, we had to complete the Positioning Lessons on Free Code Camp first. 

There was onyl 7 [Free Code Camp Lessons](https://freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/change-an-elements-relative-position)) on Positioning: 
1. Change an Element's Relative Position
2.  Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets
3. Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning
4. Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning
5. Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property
6. Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property
7. Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property

We had to begin creating our [webpage](https://app.pickcode.io/share/cm3ndop7x9svk9fpuzivm2qnp) after we had completed the lessons and taken notes on each one. The purpose of the webpage was to explain the teachings to the other students in my class. During class, we worked on our portions of the webpage after first laying it out. We went with the flow because we didn't really have a clear plan. Following the completion of our webpage, we got to work on our presentation. During the presentation, we had to be aware of what to say and do. After outlining the main concepts of our presentation in writing, we presented. Presentations followed the order of the classes; for instance, those who had the basics presented first, followed by colors, positioning, geometry, and animation.
